# Description
This layout showcases a perfume bottle's image alongside its product information in a two-column format. Centered in the viewport, the product card shifts to a vertical arrangement for smaller screens. The image adapts gracefully to changes in both horizontal and vertical viewport dimensions. The design includes a button whose style transforms upon mouseover.

# Frontend Mentor
This is a challenge from [frontendmentor.io](frontendmentor.io). The website is a place where many challenges are provided for people looking to hone their frontend skills. The aim is to recreate the image as best as possible, and have it be responsive.
